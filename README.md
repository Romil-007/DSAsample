# LEARNING DSA IN THIS REPO FROM SCRATCH


1> StatictoDynamicArray -:  This program imports a c type array and converts it into dynamic array using classes and generators it has implemented pop,append,print,remove,insert,find,len,delete,index.
I have used the ctype library to get the static array (with refrential type) which let me modify it to almost functional dynamic array. Still it may have some error that I'm yet to find so feel free to tell me the error or solution . THANK YOU
